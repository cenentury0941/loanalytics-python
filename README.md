# Loanalytics

## Overview

    - Loanalytics consists of a multi-step approach to screen and validate loan applicants using data analytics and AI.
    - Our solution implements a process involving up to 3 steps to analyse a loan applicant’s risk factor using which 
     the applicant is allowed or denied a loan.
    - Once a loan is sanctioned, the system will continuously monitor the financial status of the applicant regularly to 
    predict a loan default in case of unforeseen circumstances after the loan application and sanction process.
    - The system focuses on customer experience as it’s a core fundamental to drive loyalty in a highly competitive 
     industry while also ensuring the bank’s financial interests are secured.

## Focal Points

    - Customer Satisfaction Our approach focuses on ensuring that clients who may be eligible for a loan aren’t 
       denied due to the inference of an AI model. Ensuring customer loyalty is highly consequential in the current competitive market
    - Multi-Modal Approach By implementing multiple models such as Random Forest Classification and Large Language 
      Models we can perform an over arching analysis of a loan applicant’s eligibility. This allows us to accurately filter out high 
      risk applicants while also ensuring that eligible applicants aren’t denied a loan.
    - Financial SecurityBy ensuring the usage of qualitative and quantitative data analytics driven filtering, we can ensure that 
      the bank can practise responsible lending by through loan default prediction and prevention. Continuous monitoring shall 
      allow us to reconsider the customers financial conditions in case unforeseen conditions elevate risk factors.

## Technology Stack

The proposed solution will make use of the following technologies:

    - ReactJS (Front-end library)
    - Random Forest Classifier (Quantitative Risk Prediction)
    - OpenAI API GPT4 (Qualitative Risk Prediction)
    - GithubPages (Static Hosting)
